  // root            |
  //   <-> relayR0   |
  //   <-> relayR1 <-|-> aggregator
  //                 |    <-> relayA0

  //                 |    <-> relayA2 <-> child2
  //
  // If you call child1.consoleNotification(), it forwards to relayA1, which
  // forwards it on to relayR1. The buck stops at the root which is responsible
  // for displaying it.
  //
  // We also offer the same HostServices API on aggregator itself.
  // If you call aggregator.consoleNotification() it just dispatches to relayA0,
  // which behaves identically to relayA1 above. (We use relayA0 here, rather
  // than handling the call inside aggregator itself, to avoid code duplication)
  //
  // If you dispose child1, it relays news of its disposal via relayA1, which
  // removes it from aggregator's list of children.
  //
  // If you dispose aggregator, it disposes all of its remaining children, and
  // relays news of its disposal via relayR1, which removes it from root's
  // list of children.
  //
  // The call to 'root.childRegister(aggregator)' is what creates relayR1.
  // This call might be across nuclide-rpc, which is why childRegister has to
  // return a promise.
  //
  // Why do we use relays? so that each child can relay messages to its parent
  // aggregator, and so the parent aggregator can know which child that message
  // was relayed from, and so we can do all this without lots of duplicate
  // methods in the HostServices interface.
